# dsa_go
**dsa_go** implements various core *data-structures* which are not available in golang natively.

Checkout implemented data-structures [here](#topics-covered).

Along with implementing these data-structures there are **leetcode problem solutions** using these very data-structures in this [repo](https://github.com/MAVERICK6912/leetcode-go).

Approach for implementing operations on each data-structure is explained like this:
